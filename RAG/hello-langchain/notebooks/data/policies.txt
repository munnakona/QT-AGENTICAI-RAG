Human resources policies define the rules and guidelines that govern employment within an organization. These policies ensure fair treatment, consistency, and a professional working environment for all employees. The company follows equal employment opportunity practices and does not discriminate based on gender, age, religion, caste, nationality, disability, or marital status. Employment may be full-time, part-time, contractual, or internship-based depending on business needs.

Employees are expected to work during the company’s defined working hours and follow attendance procedures. Regular attendance and punctuality are mandatory. Absence or late arrival without prior approval may result in disciplinary action. Leave is provided to support employee well-being and includes casual leave, sick leave, earned leave, and public holidays as declared by the organization. All leave requests must be approved by the reporting manager, except in emergencies where timely communication is required.
