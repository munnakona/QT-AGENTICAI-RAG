CONCEPT 3: VELOCITY

Velocity is a physical quantity that tells us how fast an object moves in a particular direction. Unlike speed, velocity includes direction, which makes it more informative. For example, saying a car moves at 60 km/h is speed, but saying it moves at 60 km/h towards the north is velocity. Velocity helps us understand motion more accurately.

Velocity is important because even if speed remains constant, a change in direction causes velocity to change. This is clearly seen in circular motion, such as a rotating fan or a moving car on a curved road. Learning velocity helps students connect motion with acceleration and prepares them for solving equations of motion.

1. Velocity is speed in a given direction.
2. Velocity is a vector quantity.
3. Velocity includes both magnitude and direction.
4. The SI unit of velocity is m/s.
5. Speed and velocity are different.
6. Speed has no direction.
7. Velocity always has direction.
8. Example: 40 km/h is speed.
9. 40 km/h north is velocity.
10. An object changing direction changes velocity.
11. Even at constant speed, velocity can change.
12. Circular motion involves changing velocity.
13. A car moving around a circular track has changing velocity.
14. Average velocity is total displacement divided by total time.
15. If displacement is zero, average velocity is zero.
16. Example: Completing one round of a circular track.
17. Displacement becomes zero.
18. Velocity depends on displacement.
19. Uniform velocity means constant speed and direction.
20. Non-uniform velocity means speed or direction changes.
21. Velocity can be positive or negative.
22. Positive velocity indicates forward direction.
23. Negative velocity indicates backward direction.
24. Velocity-time graphs represent motion.
25. Straight horizontal line shows constant velocity.
26. Sloping line shows changing velocity.
27. The area under velocity-time graph gives displacement.
28. Velocity is important in navigation.
29. Velocity is important in sports.
30. Throwing a ball involves velocity.
31. Velocity affects stopping distance.
32. Higher velocity means longer stopping distance.
33. Safety rules depend on velocity understanding.
34. Speed limits control vehicle velocity.
35. Velocity is used in equations of motion.
36. Velocity links motion and acceleration.
37. Velocity changes when force is applied.
38. Velocity helps predict future position.
39. Velocity is central to mechanics.
40. Understanding velocity helps understand real-life motion.
